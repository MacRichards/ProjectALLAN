## :trophy: Placing

At the award ceremny this project placed 1st place in the communications catagory.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration was the lack of access to vital web pages at scout camp. We decided to use cached web page and expanded from there in order to get our final product.

## What it does
Offline website that uses a cached web page in order to provide online resources offline. Includes offline chat functionality and integrated admin panel.

## How we built it
We built it using php as the main logic with it supporting html, javascript, and css. We used open source coding to save time and we also used bootstrap to help us style the page. We are using an apache server hosted through wamp in order to access in the offline, since wamp is an offline developer web sever that we repurposed for our project.
